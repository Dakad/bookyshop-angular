Welcome to my AngularJs 2's project!

This app is a virtual BookShop. I konw, it's very original idea.

It's just usual getting-started-app to learning a new language.

## Explanations

1) It's a virtual shop for books.

2) As a visitor, you can only visualize all books on the shop.

3) You must be authenticated to buy a book or make a recommendation or comment on a book.

4) The last but not the least, only an admin user can add/edit/delete books.
